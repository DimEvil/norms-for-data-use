# INBO norms for data use and publication (Based on Canadensys)

## Purpose

[This repository] (https://github.com/DimEvil/norms-for-data-use) contains the forked *norms for data use and publication*, developed as used by [Canadensys](http://www.canadensys.net), a network of Canadian biological collections. The original norms are published at <http://www.canadensys.net/norms>. These norms will be adapted for INBO. The Research Institute for Nature and Forest. [INBO] (www.inbo.be)

These norms are not a legal document, but encourage (our) publishers and users to share and use data in a way that helps to build a vibrant community around the data and support future efforts to unlock biodiversity data.

## Fork us

By hosting [these norms on Github in Markdown format](https://github.com/Canadensys/canadensys-norms/blob/master/norms.md), we can keep track of their revision history and hope to encourage others to fork and adapt them for their own needs. We'd love to see more communities working with open data and we hope these norms can help you to build those.
